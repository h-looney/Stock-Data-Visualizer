To run our Stock Data Visualizer you will be using the files "app.py" (app), "helpers.py" (helpers), and "StockDataChart.py" (SDC) so make sure that those three file remain in the same folder, the rest are test programs or files that are unnecessary to running the program.

Instructions:
----------------------------
Open your system's terminal.
Navigate to the folder or directory you have these files (app, helpers, SDC) stored in.
Type "python app.py" into the command line.
The program will then direct your input from there.

Enjoy!
